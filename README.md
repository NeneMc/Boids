# Boids
Python Implementation of boids algorithm

This was done as an undergraduate project with a friend. 
I implemented the structure of the code including classes, animation etc. and also implemented the Euler-Cromer rule for the evolution of the system. This can be found in Swarm-V1.0.
My friend Colm took the project further and implemented a predator boid that the flock attempt to avoid and also a wind mechanic. This can be found in colms-code-1.3.
Also in here is a gif of the flock evolving over time as well as our paper for the project.
